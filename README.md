 Data Pre Processing Using Python

Data source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set

This is a basic project to understand the dataset and to remove any form of inconsistent element that could be an obstacle for analysis.
The overall project contains 6 major parts which are as follows:

##Importing the Libraries and Dataset:
The major libraries that are useful in PreProcessing are Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn and Matplotlib. Followed by this we would import the dataset.
   
##Viewing and underastanding the dataset:
Prior to conducting any analysis, it is essential to gain a comprehensive understanding of the dataset's structure and identify any significant inconsistencies within it. These inconsistencies could potentially pose significant obstacles during the analysis process.
   
##Dealing with the missing values:
The dataset doesnot have any missing values. Datas with missing values must be properly treated in order to execute a proper analysis. This involves replacing the missing values with mean median or mode

##Finding correlation between each features:
Correlation is the statistical measue that quantifies the strength and linear relationship between two variables. A correlation of -1 or Negative correlation indicates that as one variable increases, the other decreases in a perfectly linear fashion. A correlation of +1 or Positive Correlaion indicates that as one variable increases, the other also increases in a perfectly linear fashion. A correlation of 0 indicates no linear relationship between the variables. In other words, they are not associated in a linear manner.

##Handling outliers:
Outliers are data points or observations that significantly deviate from the majority of the data in a dataset. In other words, outliers are values that are unusual or different from the typical pattern or distribution of data points within a dataset. Outliers can be exceptionally high or low values and are often much farther away from the central tendency (such as the mean or median) than most other data points.

##Understanding the statistical distribution of the dataset:
The distribution of data points in a dataset signifies how the values or observations are spread or arranged across different possible values. It provides important information about the underlying patterns, characteristics, and properties of the data. Analyzing the distribution of data can help you understand key aspects of your dataset, including central tendency, variability, and the presence of outliers.
